# Containers, Kubernetes and Serverless to automate Appsec and OSINT workflows

Modern infrastructure like Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless & Cloud Native services are perfect for executing application security workflows and gathering open source intelligence. In this day and age, simply doing ad-hoc security testing is not very effective in thwarting attacks and is inefficient. By leveraging security management workflows for application security and OSINT, we can supercharge small security teams to secure, audit and test large enterprise-wide application infrastructure continuously.


## In this workshop, we will demonstrate how simple it is to

* Fully Automated Deployment security tools on a Kubernetes (K8S) cluster
* Expose command line tools with REST-based APIs
* Connect everything using serverless and cloud-native services
* All of this safely behind Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication Once everything is set up, we will demonstrate how we can conduct application-level scanning and gathering OSINT with visualizing the data with security dashboards.


## Key features of the workshop

* We will be using only free and open source tools
* Sharing our knowledge of the setups and tools usage
* Sharing any scripts/configurations that we will use
* 100% live demos with some time to explain our design choices and answer any questions
